Whack A Mole Game

Thanks to Ania Kubow from freeCodeCamp.org for the tutorial on the basic whack a mole game. I made several changes and improvements.
I added CSS styling to make the screen appear like the outdoors. I created the mole-hole and mole images from scratch with Adobe Illustrator.
I added a reset button and made it so the "game over" text and final score appear directly on the page instead of in a popup alert.
I also added a media query to make the site responsive for mobile screens.
